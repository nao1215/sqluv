The **sqluv (sql + love)** provides a TUI for executing SQL queries on local CSV, TSV, and LTSV files. Currently, it supports only simple SELECT queries. In the future, it is planned to offer functionality to operate as a client for multiple DBMSs.

The sqluv is a command derived from [nao1215/sqly](https://github.com/nao1215/sqly). Its starting point is to provide a more user-friendly interface for writing SQL compared to sqly.
